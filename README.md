Soule Designs Orchard
=======
Customized version of Orchard CMS for the Soule Designs site.  Tried not to modify the core but made minor changes to RSS feeds to allow for truncated descriptions and other minor project updates to solve build warning.  

As of the inital release using these 3rd party modules:

* Contrib.ImportExport - edited (read "hacked") to allow importing directly from Blogger Atom due to issues with Blog ML import and formatting
* Contrib.Widgets
* LatestTwitter - edited to allow for the date format I wanted to dispay, example  rather than "1 day ago" uses "Apr 9"
* PlanetTelex.ContactForm
* SH.GoogleAnalytics
* Szmyd.Orchard.Modules.Sharing
* Vandalay Industries - using the classy and meta features only 

Also, added "ImgWrap" plugin to TinyMCE so I could easily recreate the blogger style image insertion format and keep my posts consistent after the change over to Orchard.

Finally, includes custom SouleDesigns theme based almost entirely off the PJS Bootstrap theme.
